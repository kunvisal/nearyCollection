## 📚 Documentation

The best place to start is our documentation hub: **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)**.

There you will find:
- [Specs & Requirements](docs/specs/)
- [Development Workflow](docs/workflows/development.md)
- [Coding Standards](docs/standards/coding-style.md)

## Quick Start

1.  Read the **[Development Workflow](docs/workflows/development.md)**.
2.  Check the **[Project Structure](docs/standards/project-structure.md)** to understand where files live.
3.  Pick a task/issue and start coding!

## Submitting Changes

Please follow the [Documentation Workflow](docs/workflows/doc-workflow.md) when making changes. If you change logic, you must update the documentation.
